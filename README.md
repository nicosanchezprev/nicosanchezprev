I always had a love for technology, after finishing my secondary studies I knew that I liked two things: 
#### 🤩📚 Computing and psychology.
I started working in a doctor's office, oriented towards administrative tasks and doing my studies in psychology at the UBA. Thanks to this, I managed to get my first computer assembled by myself, after an arduous investigation on how to do it and what components it required. That was my first foray into technology, from that, due to my own research and curiosity, I was able to delve into web development courses. 
Today, as a full stack developer, I am looking for improve and increase my knowledge day by day in the IT work environment.
